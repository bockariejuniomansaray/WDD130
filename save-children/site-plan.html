      <h3>Homeless children</h3>
      <p>
        There are thousands of homeless children out there, with no place to go, talk less of roof over their head, every day in the street is like a nightmare for them, children has been going through this for God knows how long now, there is no place to sleep or place to call home, imagine during the raining season, how will some of this kids survive, with no roof over their head, or place to rush too. Between 2012 and 2013, the rate of homelessness among children rose by 8% nationally. “That means that 1 in 30 American children—2.5 million—were homeless in 2013,” in Sierra Leone the homelessness of female is about 52.6%, and for the men is about 47.4%. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3847326. The typical family experiencing homelessness in 2013, according to the report, consists of an African-American mother under the age of 27 with two small children; 51% of children who experience homelessness are under the age of six. Undergo Domestic violence, sexual abuse, and other types of interpersonal violence are widespread among this group of women; 90% have experienced severe trauma. And many more will go through these trauma, if no one come to their rescued. Because every day for this people is like leaving in hell.

      <h3>No food for the children</h3>
      <p>
        Being in the street every day with no food to eat, or any place to go for food, is frustrating, imagine how long can they survive with no food. 45% of all child deaths worldwide are from causes related to undernutrition. That's 3.1 million children each year. About 1 in 9 people on earth don't have enough food to lead a healthy, active life. 66 million primary school-age children attend classes hungry across the developing world. And so many things are happening, there are some home, that can't aford one meal for the day talk less of thinking of having a food, for the rest of the day this kids will be going around the street with no food to eat, or somewhere to find food Hunger, finding food is a complicated problem without a simple solution. On a basic level, hunger means not having the food you need to meet your energy needs. But people in poverty face a lot of food-related issues including malnutrition and many others, obesity and stunting. I believe children and youth cannot thrive in other areas of their life while suffering from food deprivation. Overall health is affected by lack of proper nutrition and children often fall behind in school due to illness or an inability to concentrate from hunger. Your sponsorship or gift creates lasting change for children and youth in these communities by providing access to nutrition programs, as well as crucial health and dental services, education programs, career-placement workshops and more. https://www.wfpusa.org/articles/10-facts-child-hunger/
